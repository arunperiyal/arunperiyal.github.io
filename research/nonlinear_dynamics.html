            <h2>Research Overview</h2>
            <p>
                My research in nonlinear dynamics focuses on understanding complex behavior in engineering systems,
                particularly in marine and offshore structures. Nonlinear phenomena such as bifurcations, chaos, and
                multi-stability play crucial roles in determining system response under realistic operating conditions.
                By employing analytical, numerical, and experimental methods, I investigate how system parameters influence
                dynamic behavior and develop strategies for predicting and controlling nonlinear responses.

            <li><strong>Parametric Excitation:</strong> Investigating parametrically excited marine structures including
            Mathieu and Hill equations, stability boundaries, and transition to chaos</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-stable Systems:</strong> Analyzing systems with multiple coexisting attractors and basin
            erosion phenomena relevant to offshore structures</li>
            <li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> Studying synchronization and lock-in phenomena in coupled oscillators
            and fluid-structure interaction</li>
            <li><strong>Perturbation Methods:</strong> Applying multiple scales, averaging, and harmonic balance techniques
            to weakly nonlinear systems</li>

        <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
        <p>
            My work has revealed important insights into the nonlinear dynamics of marine risers under combined
            parametric and direct excitation. Through bifurcation analysis, I have identified parameter regions where
            sudden transitions in response amplitude occur, which has implications for fatigue life prediction. I have
            developed reduced-order models that capture essential nonlinear features while enabling rapid analysis for
            design purposes. Additionally, my research on chaotic dynamics has demonstrated scenarios where traditional
            linear analysis fails to predict actual system behavior, highlighting the importance of nonlinear approaches
            in marine engineering.

        <h3>Analytical Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lyapunov stability analysis and exponent calculation</li>
            <li>Floquet theory for parametrically excited systems</li>
            <li>Method of multiple scales for weakly nonlinear oscillators</li>
            <li>Harmonic balance and continuation methods</li>
            <li>Phase plane and Poincaré section analysis</li>
            <li>Melnikov method for homoclinic chaos prediction</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <p>
            The nonlinear dynamics research has direct applications in predicting and preventing catastrophic failures
            in offshore structures. Understanding bifurcation behavior helps identify safe operating envelopes where
            large amplitude responses are avoided. The analysis of multi-stability informs risk assessment by
            quantifying the probability of jumps between response states. Insights from chaos theory guide the design
            of control strategies that exploit or suppress chaotic behavior as needed. These findings contribute to
            improved safety standards and operational guidelines for marine and offshore industries.
        </p>

        <h3>Future Directions</h3>
        <p>
            Future research will explore machine learning approaches for detecting early warning signs of bifurcations
            from time series data. I am also investigating network dynamics to understand how nonlinear interactions
            propagate through complex offshore structural systems. Experimental validation of theoretical predictions
            in controlled laboratory settings remains a priority. Additionally, extending the analysis to high-dimensional
            systems using manifold-based techniques will enable more realistic modeling of industrial-scale structures.
