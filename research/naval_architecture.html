            <h2>Research Overview</h2>
            <p>
                My naval architecture research encompasses fundamental ship design principles, hydrodynamic analysis,
                structural mechanics, and performance optimization. The work combines theoretical foundations with
                computational methods and experimental validation to address challenges in modern ship and offshore
                structure design. Key focus areas include hull form optimization, seakeeping performance, resistance
                and propulsion, and structural strength assessment.

        <h3>Research Domains</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hull Form Optimization:</strong> Developing computational frameworks for multi-objective optimization
            of ship hulls considering resistance, seakeeping, and stability constraints</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance and Propulsion:</strong> Investigating novel hull forms and appendages to reduce resistance
            and improve propulsive efficiency using CFD and model testing</li>
            <li><strong>Seakeeping Analysis:</strong> Predicting ship motions in waves using potential flow theory, strip
            theory, and advanced panel methods</li>
            <li><strong>Stability and Safety:</strong> Analyzing intact and damaged stability, parametric roll resonance,
            and pure loss of stability phenomena</li>
            <li><strong>Structural Mechanics:</strong> Evaluating longitudinal strength, fatigue life, and structural response
            to wave loading using finite element analysis</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Computational Approaches</h3>
        <p>
            The research employs a hierarchy of computational tools ranging from rapid empirical methods to high-fidelity
            CFD simulations. For resistance prediction, I use a combination of Michell thin-ship theory, slender-body
            methods, and RANS solvers. Seakeeping analysis is performed using 2D strip theory for preliminary design
            and 3D panel methods for detailed evaluation. Structural analysis employs beam theory for global responses
            and finite element methods for local stress assessment. Optimization algorithms including genetic algorithms,
            particle swarm optimization, and gradient-based methods are integrated with these analysis tools.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Research Contributions</h3>
        <p>
            My work on hull form optimization has demonstrated that multi-objective approaches considering both calm
            water resistance and seakeeping performance can achieve 12-15% improvement in fuel efficiency without
            compromising operational safety. I have developed efficient meta-models using Gaussian processes that reduce
            the computational cost of optimization by two orders of magnitude. Research on parametric roll has identified
            critical wave conditions for various ship types and proposed design modifications to mitigate this dangerous
            phenomenon. Additionally, my structural analysis work has contributed to improved fatigue life prediction
            methods for ships operating in harsh environments.
        </p>

        <h3>Design Tools and Software</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>MAXSURF and Rhinoceros for hull modeling and hydrostatics</li>
            <li>ANSYS Fluent and Star-CCM+ for CFD analysis</li>
            <li>MOSES and AQWA for seakeeping and mooring analysis</li>
            <li>ABAQUS and NASTRAN for structural finite element analysis</li>
            <li>Custom Python and MATLAB codes for optimization and post-processing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Industry Collaboration and Applications</h3>
        <p>
            The research findings have been applied in collaboration with shipyards and classification societies to
            improve designs of commercial vessels, offshore support vessels, and naval ships. Hull form optimization
            methodologies have been implemented in the design of a series of chemical tankers, resulting in measurable
            fuel savings. Seakeeping prediction tools are being used for operational decision support, helping vessels
            avoid dangerous wave conditions. The structural analysis frameworks contribute to more accurate scantling
            requirements and lighter ship structures without compromising safety.
        </p>

        <h3>Educational Contributions</h3>
        <p>
            Beyond research, I have developed educational resources including interactive ship design tools, lecture
            materials on ship hydrostatics and stability, and case studies illustrating naval architecture principles.
            These materials are used in undergraduate and graduate courses, helping students understand complex concepts
            through visualization and hands-on computation. I have also mentored student projects on topics ranging from
            autonomous surface vehicles to innovative hull forms for green shipping.
        </p>

        <h3>Future Research Directions</h3>
        <p>
            Future work will focus on digital twin technologies for ships, enabling real-time performance monitoring
            and predictive maintenance. I am exploring autonomous ship design considerations including sensor placement,
            collision avoidance systems, and redundancy requirements. Research on alternative fuels and propulsion systems
            will address the transition to zero-emission shipping. Additionally, investigating biomimetic hull forms
            inspired by marine organisms may lead to breakthrough improvements in hydrodynamic efficiency.
