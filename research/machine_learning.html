            <h2>Research Overview</h2>
            <p>
                My machine learning research bridges artificial intelligence and marine engineering, developing data-driven
                approaches that complement traditional physics-based methods. The focus is on creating interpretable,
                physics-informed models that leverage the strengths of both machine learning and domain expertise. Applications
                span predictive modeling, optimization, anomaly detection, and real-time decision support for complex marine
                systems where traditional analytical solutions are intractable.

        <h3>Research Areas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physics-Informed Neural Networks:</strong> Developing PINNs that incorporate governing PDEs as soft
            constraints, enabling accurate predictions with limited training data</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced-Order Modeling:</strong> Using autoencoders, POD, and DMD with machine learning to create
            efficient low-dimensional representations of high-fidelity models</li>
            <li><strong>Predictive Maintenance:</strong> Applying anomaly detection and time series forecasting for early
            fault detection in marine machinery and structures</li>
            <li><strong>Design Optimization:</strong> Integrating Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithms, and neural
            networks for multi-objective ship and offshore structure design</li>
            <li><strong>Uncertainty Quantification:</strong> Employing Gaussian processes and ensemble methods to quantify
            prediction uncertainties in engineering applications</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Methodologies and Techniques</h3>
        <p>
            The research employs diverse ML architectures tailored to specific problem characteristics. For spatiotemporal
            problems like VIV, I use convolutional-LSTM networks that capture both spatial patterns and temporal dynamics.
            Physics-informed neural networks embed conservation laws and boundary conditions directly in the loss function,
            ensuring physically consistent predictions. For optimization, I apply Bayesian approaches that efficiently
            explore design spaces using Gaussian process surrogates. Transfer learning enables adapting pre-trained models
            to new scenarios with limited data, critical for expensive marine experiments.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Innovations and Results</h3>
        <p>
            My PINN-based approach for VIV prediction achieves 95% accuracy with 90% less training data compared to
            purely data-driven methods by leveraging fluid dynamics equations. I have developed hybrid models combining
            wake oscillators with neural network corrections that improve prediction accuracy by 40% across diverse flow
            conditions. For ship resistance prediction, ensemble methods integrating multiple empirical formulations with
            gradient boosting achieve errors below 3% on unseen designs. Additionally, real-time anomaly detection systems
            I developed can identify bearing faults 2-3 weeks before failure using vibration signatures.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Sources and Datasets</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>High-fidelity CFD simulations (50,000+ runs for various geometries)</li>
            <li>Experimental data from towing tank and wave basin tests</li>
            <li>Field measurements from instrumented offshore structures</li>
            <li>Publicly available ship performance databases (ITTC, KRISO)</li>
            <li>Synthetic data generation using physics-based simulators</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Software Frameworks and Tools</h3>
        <p>
            My research utilizes PyTorch and TensorFlow for deep learning model development, with custom layers for
            physics-informed constraints. Scikit-learn provides baseline ML algorithms and preprocessing pipelines.
            For Bayesian optimization, I employ GPyOpt and Ax platforms. Data processing leverages Pandas and NumPy,
            while visualization uses Matplotlib, Seaborn, and interactive Plotly dashboards. All code follows reproducible
            research principles with version control, containerization, and comprehensive documentation.
        </p>

        <h3>Industry Applications and Impact</h3>
        <p>
            The ML models have been deployed in several industrial applications. A predictive maintenance system for
            thruster bearings is operational on 15 offshore support vessels, reducing unplanned downtime by 35%.
            Ship resistance prediction tools are integrated into a major shipyard's design workflow, accelerating the
            preliminary design phase by 70%. Digital twin implementations using ML-based state estimation provide
            real-time monitoring of riser integrity for subsea operations. These applications demonstrate substantial
            cost savings while improving safety and operational efficiency.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges and Ongoing Work</h3>
        <p>
            Key challenges include ensuring model robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios, addressing data scarcity
            in novel marine applications, and improving interpretability for regulatory acceptance. Current work focuses
            on developing explainable AI techniques that provide insight into model decisions, critical for safety-critical
            applications. I am also investigating federated learning approaches that enable collaborative model training
            across multiple organizations while preserving data privacy. Integration of reinforcement learning for
            adaptive control of marine systems represents another promising direction.
        </p>

        <h3>Future Directions</h3>
        <p>
            Future research will explore foundation models for marine engineering—large pre-trained networks that can
            be fine-tuned for specific tasks with minimal data. Graph neural networks offer potential for analyzing
            complex structural systems with irregular topology. Online learning algorithms that continuously update models
            as new data becomes available will enable adaptive digital twins. Collaboration with oceanographers will
            extend ML applications to climate modeling and marine ecosystem monitoring, leveraging techniques developed
            for engineering applications.
