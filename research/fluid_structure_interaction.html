            <h2>Research Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) represents one of the most challenging and important areas in marine
                engineering. My research focuses on understanding and predicting the coupled behavior between flowing
                fluids and flexible structures, particularly in offshore and marine applications. This involves developing
                computational frameworks, conducting experimental validation, and creating reduced-order models that capture
                essential physics while remaining computationally tractable for engineering design.

        <h3>Research Focus Areas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vortex-Induced Vibrations:</strong> Investigating lock-in, amplitude response, frequency behavior,
            and fatigue damage in flexible cylinders subjected to cross-flow</li>
            <li><strong>Computational FSI:</strong> Developing efficient coupling algorithms using CFD and FEM with
            advanced mesh motion techniques and interface treatment</li>
            <li><strong>VIV Suppression:</strong> Designing and evaluating passive and active suppression devices including
            helical strakes, fairings, and grooved surfaces</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-span Risers:</strong> Analyzing complex FSI in multi-span configurations with varying currents
            and soil interaction</li>
            <li><strong>Turbulence Modeling:</strong> Evaluating RANS, LES, and hybrid approaches for accurate prediction
            of unsteady fluid forces</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Methodological Approaches</h3>
        <p>
            My research employs a multi-pronged approach combining high-fidelity simulations, reduced-order modeling,
            and experimental validation. For high-fidelity analysis, I use coupled CFD-FEM frameworks with two-way
            interaction to capture the full physics. The structural domain is modeled using nonlinear beam elements or
            shell elements depending on the problem, while the fluid domain employs Large Eddy Simulation or hybrid
            RANS-LES turbulence models. To make the analysis tractable for design purposes, I develop reduced-order
            models based on wake oscillators, proper orthogonal decomposition, and physics-informed neural networks.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Findings and Contributions</h3>
        <p>
            Through systematic parametric studies, I have identified critical mass-damping combinations that govern VIV
            response regimes. My work on helical groove suppression devices has demonstrated up to 70% reduction in
            vibration amplitudes through disruption of spanwise vortex correlation. I have developed efficient partitioned
            FSI coupling schemes that maintain stability while reducing computational cost by an order of magnitude
            compared to monolithic approaches. Additionally, my research on wake oscillator calibration has produced
            improved models that accurately capture higher harmonic responses and transition between response branches.

        <h3>Computational Tools and Software</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>OpenFOAM and ANSYS Fluent for CFD analysis</li>
            <li>ABAQUS and custom FEM codes for structural dynamics</li>
            <li>preCICE for partitioned FSI coupling</li>
            <li>Python and MATLAB for reduced-order modeling</li>
            <li>ParaView and Tecplot for visualization</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applications and Impact</h3>
        <p>
            The FSI research has direct applications in offshore oil and gas industry for riser design, pipeline
            installation, and fatigue life prediction. The VIV suppression technologies developed through this research
            are being considered for implementation on deepwater drilling risers, potentially saving millions in
            maintenance costs and preventing catastrophic failures. The reduced-order models enable rapid design space
            exploration and real-time monitoring applications. Furthermore, the computational frameworks developed are
            applicable to other FSI problems including wind turbine blade dynamics and aircraft flutter.
        </p>

        <h3>Ongoing and Future Work</h3>
        <p>
            Current research focuses on developing machine learning-enhanced FSI models that can predict responses with
            minimal computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. I am also investigating multi-physics coupling
            that includes thermal effects and erosion, which are important for subsea pipelines. Future work will extend
            the FSI framework to include uncertainty quantification, enabling probabilistic design approaches. Collaboration
            with industry partners will facilitate full-scale validation and technology transfer of VIV suppression devices.
